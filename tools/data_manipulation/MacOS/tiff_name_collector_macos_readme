🧾 TIFF Folder Scanner
This Python tool scans a selected folder (and all its subfolders) for TIFF image files (.tif / .tiff) and generates an Excel spreadsheet listing:
Institution name
Folder name
File name
Full file path
Relative file path
It uses a simple Tkinter GUI for folder selection and pop-up messages.

🚀 Features
Recursively scans all subfolders for TIFF files
Automatically includes folder, filename, and path details
Saves the results to an Excel file named tiff_files_list.xlsx in the selected folder
User-friendly pop-up dialogs for instructions, errors, and completion messages

🧰 Requirements
You’ll need Python 3 installed, along with the following dependencies:
pip install pandas openpyxl
💡 openpyxl is required for writing .xlsx files.

🧑‍💻 Usage
Download or clone this repository.
Run the script in your terminal or IDE:
python3 tiff_scanner.py
When prompted, select the main institution folder containing all your collection subfolders.
The tool will search recursively for .tif and .tiff files.
Once complete, an Excel file named tiff_files_list.xlsx will be saved in the same main folder.
